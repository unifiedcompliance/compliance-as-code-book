# Compliance as Code and the no-code movement

No-code is a way of developing MVP \(minimum viable product\) tools that uses drag-and-drop programming and is about _what_ not _how_ - you tell the system what you want, and build it. It allows end-users to become quasi-developers and build functional \(but limited\) applications _without writing a single line of code_.

In the world of Compliance as Code where digital transformation and innovation play a critical role in _how_ we comply, speed and automation, coupled with a standardized approach can mean the difference between moving forward and falling behind.

## The benefits and risks of no-code development of Compliance as Code projects

The benefits are twofold: speed and the use of resources.

### Ease of development translating into Speed

No-code development is done within coding frameworks and applications, such as Bubble.io \(our preferred method\) and its competitors. It is drag-and-drop and the programming framework handles routing, scalability, etc.

MVPs are broken down into design, flow, data handling logic, and everything else is handled through plugins that do the “heavy lifting”. Period.

On top of that, an entire marketplace exists for pre-built templates, forms, plugins, and other elements that further speed up the process.

Because of this, you don’t need a background in software development. Pick a template, make changes to the look and feel, certain aspects of content and data handling, and you have an MVP you can stand up within your organization as a “here’s how we can transform this type of compliance data into actionable results”.

### The risks

Yeah, of course there are risks – mostly limiting factors.

#### Customization is somewhat limited

The development platforms provide you with _a limited set_ of design, flow, data handling logic. Adapting to using no-code platforms are like getting a new pair of cowboy boots – your feet change to fit the boots, not the other way around. Instead of providing the option to customize the development system, no-code platforms require you to change your business processes to meet their capabilities.

#### Customization is built outside the platform

All of the “heavy lifting” of data crunching, and sometimes even data structures, is done _outside_ of the no-code platform.

The “heavy lifting” is normally either integrated into the no-code platform through a plugin or through API calls that do the crunching for you.

So if you want something done outside of what the tool provides, you will be dealing with your core developers to get those plugins or API calls built.

## Where does no-code fit in to Compliance as Code?

Below is an illustration of the Compliance as Code environment. On the left we have the output \(computer readable or human readable\) and on the right is the JSON schema that is the foundation for Compliance as Code.

No-code lives within the _requesting application_. It’s the _way to build the tools_ to request the data from the API processes in order to display that data to computers or humans.
