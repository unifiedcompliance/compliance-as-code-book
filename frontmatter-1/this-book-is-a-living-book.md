# This book is a living book

I hate when a book blathers at you. Ugh. You pick it up, start reading, and think, “what the heck does that mean” – and have no one to turn to but Google. Screw that. We want you to participate. There are four ways:

### Join the discussion

The folks at GRCschema.org are graciously allowing us to invite anyone onto their discussion server to talk about this book. The signup is here: [https://listserv.grcschema.org/register](https://listserv.grcschema.org/register). The topic to follow is the title of this work, Compliance as Code. If you don’t understand some-thing, bring it up! If you think we are full of it, bring it up! If you want to contribute, bring it up!

### Get the emails

We will be sending emails to everyone who signs up to get them about what’s going on, where we are at, what can be tested, etc. To sign up, click here: [https://www.unifiedcompliance.com/email-signup/](https://www.unifiedcompliance.com/email-signup/) and click the Compliance as Code checkbox. You will never receive unsolicited messages and your email address is never shared.

### Become an active tester!

The URL for testing will change. The only way to find out is to either join the listserv or get the emails. Once you do, you’ll get the correct URL and you’ll be off to the races, taking part in what the software looks like, giving us feedback, the whole nine yards!

### Become a signatory

We need your support. We need you to become a signatory of the Compliance as Code procla-mation. The URL is here: [https://edu.unifiedcompliance.com/complianceascode/](https://edu.unifiedcompliance.com/complianceascode/) Sign up, help us spread the word that laws, regulations, and standards are written on comput-ers. Why shouldn’t they contain machine-readable information? By signing up, you agree that with the advent of natural language processing and artificial intel-ligence, the interpretation of these documents should not be done by nameless people in a back room that want no credit and provide no proof of their work? By signing up, you are saying that you agree policies, standards, and procedures should instruct both people and computers to behave the way we want. Please, sign up.
