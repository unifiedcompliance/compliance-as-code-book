# Landing Pages

### The Landing Page

Landing Pages for each section will describe the overall contents of the section, and the section’s uses.

1. The simplest of landing pages will have a 40 point centered title followed by 16 point text that explains the contents and usage of the section.

To make the landing page MVP really useful, you need not just to introduce your software concept to the visitors of your website, but to build a conversation with them. Naturally, you can’t explicitly ask your potential clients what they want your product to be: it works against the ‘coming-soon’ idea and is impractical since users often don’t know what they want when they are asked about it directly.
