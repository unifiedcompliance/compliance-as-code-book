# No Code Design Elements

### No-Code Design elements

Often, the terms **data** and **information** are used interchangeably. They shouldn’t be. There is a difference between the two. **Data** can be a number, symbol, character, word, codes, graphs, etc. **Information** is **data** put into context. **Information **exists when data are processed, interpreted, organized, structured or presented so as to make that data meaningful or useful.

And **design** is a key part of making data useful.

Within the world of Compliance as Code, **data** lives in the content delivered through the API. It is given _some_ structure by the schema. Some processing is done by the APIs as well. However, it can’t really be presented for interpretation without some form of design so that it can be presented on screen or in printable form.

That’s where this conversation comes into play. Here we will tackle the problem of presenting Compliance as Code on screen, through the development of no-code minimum viable products (MVPs). Particularly a desktop screen. We will present the elements of what can (and should) be designed for desktop screens in such a way that they are can be standardized, and therefore shared.

### Design Tools

There are a _bunch_ of tools that you can use for designs. We are going to focus on only two of them (both of which can be used in a standard browser):

Balsamiq ([https://balsamiq.cloud](https://balsamiq.cloud)), a web-based user interface design tool for creating wireframes (sometimes called mockups or low-fidelity prototypes). You can use it to generate digital sketches of your idea or concept for an application or website, to aid in discussion and understanding before any code is written. The completed wireframes can be used for user testing, clarifying your vision, getting feedback from stakeholders, or getting approval to start development.

Figma ([https://figma.com](https://figma.com)), a web-based design tool (akin to Sketch) that _can also_ be used as user interface design tool for creating highly interactive wireframes. For many Bubble.io no-code developers out there, Figma is the go-to platform for creating software prototypes as there is an API that allows developers to take the Figma wireframes and import them directly into Bubble.io.
