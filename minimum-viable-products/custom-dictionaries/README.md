# Custom Dictionaries

What do the various regulations mean when they say this or that? What do _we_, _our team_ mean when we write this or that in our policies, standards, and procedures? Ever wanted to have a dictionary just for the terms _your_ organization uses? That's what we are building.

The Corporate Dictionary MVP is an open-source tool allowing users to compile their own dictionaries and term lists from several sources, including the federated dictionary, the UCF’s Compliance Dictionary, Merriam Webster, and the Oxford English Dictionary.

This tool is broken down into several sections:

_Search_ allows you to search multiple dictionaries, examine definitions and term relationships, and then select the terms which you would like to add to your corporate dictionary or term lists.

_Term Frequencies_ shows you how often terms you search for are found within the various corpora you have.

_Concordance_ shows you a _Key Word In Context_ (KWIC) view of the terms in the various corpora you have.

_Create/Edit Terms_ allows you to create new terms, definitions, and relationships, or edit existing ones.

_Manage Corpora_ allows you to manage the files you’ll bring in containing examples for your terms.
