# User Stories

The following are the user stories supporting the building of a custom organizational dictionary.

## I'm a policy/procedure writer

I want to create an organizational dictionary based on content our team is writing.

* There isn't a way to scan our text and make it easy to find which words we need to add.
* Is there a process to write a definition that's a good definition? How do we know which ones are good and which aren't?
* I wish we had an easy way to select text and follow guidelines to create dictionary terms.

## I manage or work with the compliance team

I want to create an organizational dictionary based on the Authority Documents we have to follow.

* Most Authority Documents don't come with glossaries. The ones that do are in different formats. We want a single format, in standard dictionary style, for all the important terms.
* Many Authority Documents' Citations create many different definitions for the same terms. How do we know which Authority Document is using which definition?
* I just want to select an Authority Document and have it display all of the terms I need to know. I want to share the list of terms from each Authority Document with my team.

## I'm a general corporate user

I want to search multiple dictionaries and select the definitions I like the most from those I found, adding those terms to my custom dictionary.

* When I search for a term, I want the search engine to go out to _multiple_ dictionaries and get _all_ of the definitions so I can select the one I want to use.
* I want to search terms in an existing dictionary and build my own custom dictionary just for the terms I find.
