# User Stories

The following are the user stories supporting the building of a custom organizational dictionary.

## I'm a policy/procedure writer

I want to create an organizational dictionary based on content our team is writing.

* There isn't a way to scan our text and make it easy to find which words we need to add.
* Is there a process to write a definition that's a good definition? How do we know which ones are good and which aren't?
* I wish we had an easy way to select text and follow guidelines to create dictionary terms.

## I manage or work with the compliance team

I want to create an organizational dictionary based on the Authority Documents we have to follow.

* Most Authority Documents don't come with glossaries. The ones that do are in different formats. We want a single format, in standard dictionary style, for all the important terms.
* Many Authority Documents' Citations create many different definitions for the same terms. How do we know which Authority Document is using which definition?
* I just want to select an Authority Document and have it display all of the terms I need to know. I want to share the list of terms from each Authority Document with my team.
* I need to send our terms **to our GRC application** so that our auditors and governance team are working from the same definitions.
* My area of expertise is Data Security, but there are many terms that are difficult to explain to stakeholders and other members of our lay audience. I would like to utilize a dictionary with the capability of creating custom lists for our stakeholders so we can route around terms _that they care about_ and need to know.

## I work in systems configuration

I want to have a single reference that contains the definitions of concepts and configurable items for multiple applications and platforms.

* I need definitions for configurable items - they can't be found in regular dictionaries.
* I need to route those definitions to the compliance and audit teams - maybe as a custom list for each team.
* I want a dedicated dictionary just for our technical needs. We don't need to intermingle our terms with normal terms.

## I'm in Information Architecture for my company

* An organizational dictionary would create consistency in language throughout the company and give direction to visitors to our website as well as create clarity for the current staff.

## I work in corporate education

Users who work with the development team but lack development experience might not know basic concepts that are expected knowledge in many technical documents.

* I want to create a dictionary that includes whichever terms we deem necessary to facilitate mutual understanding between technical and non-technical team members, to be used for educational purposes.

## I'm a general corporate user

I want to search multiple dictionaries and select the definitions I like the most from those I found, adding those terms to my custom dictionary.

* When I search for a term, I want the search engine to go out to _multiple_ dictionaries and get _all_ of the definitions so I can select the one I want to use.
* I want to search terms in an existing dictionary and build my own custom dictionary just for the terms I find.
