# User Stories

The following are the user stories supporting the building of a standardized account management system.

## I’m a developer that uses APIs

I need to access multiple API resources and gateways. I want to ensure that the account information I am sharing between them is kept in sync.

## I’m an in-house developer

I want to build multiple applications that share data associated with shared user accounts. I want to receive data from my hosted SaaS providers and ensure that the account, user, or group information is synched between my local data and applications and those of my hosted applications.

## I’m a content contributor

My team wants to contribute content to multiple federated systems, and therefore we want to create our account structure locally and then sync that structure to the various federated systems we are contributing to.
