# The Standardized Account

The world of Compliance as Code and federated data is a world of shared data1. When sharing data in this world you are sharing data between systems - _not_ users. Sharing data between users can be done in various ways such as e-mail, text, chat, or even phone calls. The trust has already been established between two people in that you’ve exchanged your addresses or phone numbers. _You_ know who you are sending data to and _they_ know from whom the data is coming. Its somewhat the same with systems; which means that when systems have to talk to each other, they have to trust each other when doing so. With systems, the trust factor is built into _each and every communication_. The systems must have

* some form of security handshake, and
* a system-based identifier for who is who.

The _who-is-who_ part is normally done in the form of an account structure. The problem is, within the world of Compliance as Code, and all of those various schemas already published2, there isn’t a standardized account structure!

Therefore, we propose a minimum viable standardized structure for account management that incorporates the following:

* Organizations that describe legal entities a person belongs to;
* Accounts that are opened and belong to the organization;
* Users who belong to the organization and can be registered to one or more Ac-counts;
* Groups and Initiatives that Users can be added to within an Account.
