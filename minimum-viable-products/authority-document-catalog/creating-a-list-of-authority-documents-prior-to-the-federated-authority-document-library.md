# Creating a list of Authority Documents prior to the Federated Authority Document Library

Now that we know what we must comply with, we have to turn our attention to creating that _list_ of Authority Documents that we are complying with. We must both create the list and _share_ the list within the organization so that everyone knows which documents are on the _must_ comply with, and which documents are on the _we should_ comply with.

Your list of Authority Documents should have the following capabilities:

* It should be updateable by everyone in the team that needs to contribute;
* It should have the capability to be displayed on your intranet or distributed within your organization; and
* Ultimately each Authority Document should be linked directly to that document’s Citations so that you can examine the text.

There are three ways you can establish and maintain your lists of Authority Documents you need to comply with:

1. Search for them yourself and create a way to publish that list internally (even if it’s a simple Word document);
2. Use paid systems like LexisNexis, Thomson Reuters, Westlaw, Loislaw, etc.,; or
3. Use the Federated Authority Document library.

## Searching for Authority Documents and managing lists manually

So what happens when you try to search for something like the General Data Protection Regulation, known to most people within the compliance world as GDPR? You get over _400 million results_.

**IF** you knew that GDPR stands for _General Data Protection Regulation_, that narrows the results down to around _20 million_. And if you look at the 1st through 10th pages of Google and try linking to the **official** text, you’ll get companies like Intersoft Consulting listing the text.

![And a Google research list contains crap, like this](https://www.complianceascode.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GoogleResearchList.png)

This is, by far, the _worst_ way of doing this. It isn’t even the cheapest (as the Federated Authority Document library is free), but some folks are stubborn, and they want to re-invent the wheel. If this is what you want to do, you should first test your search skills. The UCF team have created an insanely short quiz and posted it online for free for anyone who wants to try their hand at searching for Authority Documents. The quiz is free and can be found online [HERE](https://edu.unifiedcompliance.com/courses/).

Most people find that they fail miserably at the searching part and don’t even get to the managing and distributing the list part.

## Using paid systems like LexisNexis

If you are a legal firm, undoubtedly you have access to such online legal research sites as Westlaw, LexisNexis, Casetext, RossIntelligence, and others. Those are pricey. **Westlaw** suggests that the average cost is around $99 per **search**, which **price** includes all the documents _clicked on_ during the search. Even then, those specialized libraries only have statutes and regulations or court cases. And some of them, such as the Ross Intelligence library, only have US Federal and State statutes and regulations. LexisNexis is able to do this for you and so much more because it is a powerhouse of public information. Over 37 billion records are contained in the database and it just continues to grow! However, it _is_ expensive. There are some other less expensive alternatives you can turn to.

**FactSet**

If you want even more specificity in your niche for your research and you have financial needs, then FactSet is a great service to consider. FactSect can be found [HERE](https://www.factset.com).

**Thomson Reuters**

Thomson Reuters is very much like LexisNexis, with focuses on healthcare, finance, and science sectors. They can be found [HERE](https://thomsonreuters.com).

**Westlaw**

It’s primarily for lawyers and covers 40k databases, but anyone who needs legal advice or help can benefit from this system. They can be found [HERE](https://web2.westlaw.com).

**Loislaw**

Covering the law libraries of all US state and federal jurisdictions, this legal database also offers a citation service that summarizes all sources in the database that cite documents and provides hyperlinks to those sources. They can be found [HERE](https://loislaw.com).

The problem with the five of these choices is that they don’t also include international standards, Secure Technical Implementation Guides, etc. Therefore, each organization needs to create and maintain _its own_ catalog of Authority Documents they need to comply with.
