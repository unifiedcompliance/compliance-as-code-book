# Authority Document Catalog

What is presented herein is the standard and methodology for a Federated Authority Document Library that is open to all organizations or individuals wishing to

• search the library for known Authority Documents;&#x20;

• create and export JSON-LD based lists of Authority Documents found in the library; and&#x20;

• add or maintain records in the library.

A single, vast, Authority Document library is needed for any practitioner within the Governance, Risk, and Compliance space because the number of documents organizations must follow to maintain compliance is growing at a fast pace. Until the establishment of this library, organizations wishing to create a list of documents they had to follow were forced into one of three situations:

1. searching the web’s myriad locations for laws, rules, regulations, etc.;
2. employing a law firm or utilizing multiple legal research tools (which are still inadequate); or
3. looking for documents in the UCF’s Common Controls Hub (which only hosts the documents that team uses).

The Federated Authority Document Library allows content contributions or use from any person or organization. It was created, and is maintained by GRCschema.org, a 501(c)(3) organization with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data within the Governance, Risk, and Compliance universe. The library is not a single URL location. It is a dynamic API driven library that is already located in many locations and can be integrated into organizational websites, GRC tools, databases, and mobile browsers.

## Research and foundation for the structure

An immense amount of research went into the publication of this content. The research documents for this content can be found at our research library HERE. The JSON-LD structure for the Federated Authority Document Library is founded upon the Functional Requirements for Biblio-graphic Records (FRBR)1, the Resource Description and Access (RDA) standard2, and additional work done by GRCSChema.org in defining the schema for AuthorityDocument3. Additional assistance was provided by three core library and cataloging groups; the ALA, IFLA, and GODORT.

| The American Library Association (ALA) is the oldest and largest library association in the world. Founded on October 6, 1876 during the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the mission of ALA is “to provide leadership for the development, promotion and improvement of library and information services and the profession of librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure access to information for all.” | The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) is the leading international body representing the interests of library and information services and their users. It is the global voice of the library and information profession. | The Government Documents Round Table (GODORT) is a dynamic forum where information professionals learn, discuss, advocate, and create scholarship on and about government information at all levels of government (local, state, national, international). |
