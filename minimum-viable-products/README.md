The **Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering**1 is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975 (I read the 1982 edition, which tells you how old I am). The theme throughout the book is that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." One of the things Brooks advocated was _software prototyping_, the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program being developed.

Prototyping served as an incubator for _prototype-based programming_, a style of object-oriented programming in which behavior reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects that serve as prototypes.

Which, in turn, has given rise to MVPs and the no-code movement. MVPs give us the ability to create rifle-shot applications to fix problems we have _now_ and integrate data we have _now_ instead of waiting months on end for our development teams to have a couple of free programming sprints to take up our cause.

## This section

This section will introduce several MVPs, each with a specific task in mind. The content will begin with user stories and proceed through the data structures, API calls, and wireframes.
