# Federated Contributors

Within the world of Compliance as Code, each person and organization is given a chance to be a contributor as well as a consumer of the data. With millions of **subject matter experts** residing in hundreds of thousands of corporations around the world, why not?

There is one pre-condition for every contributing person or organization -- they must be _known_. There isn't a place for unknown, or masked, contributors within the world of compliance. All contributions are attributed to _someone_ as the author, editor, etc. Even if that _someone_ is an organization.
