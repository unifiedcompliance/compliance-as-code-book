# Compliance as Code

Compliance as Code gives us the structures to read, interpret, and output compliance requirements in human and machine-readable formats simultaneously. It also allows us to standardize our responses to these requirements concurrently in human and ma-chine-readable formats. Consequently, acquisition, interpretation, and response to compliance requirements can be shared ubiquitously through independent language data formats such as JSON-LD.

What does that do for us?

* It allows us to acquire and store compliance content in a standardized model.
* It allows the use of Natural Language Processing tools to programmatically de-duce meaning instead of humans guessing at an author’s meaning.
* It allows us to connect the various elements together through scientific means ra-ther than opinion alignment.
* It allows us to make compliance requirements interoperable with compliance im-plementation and validation.

This book walks us through the international community’s various efforts to implement multiple forms of Compliance as Code and uncovers what works, what doesn’t, and where to go from here.
